        <p>5 August</p>
        <p>Nic and Will brainstormed ideas for the battle bot design.</p>
        <p>Compared prebuilt chassis vs. custom build options.</p>
        <p>
          Decided to go with a custom design with additional features from
          prebuilt chassis for more flexibility in weapon and motor integration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Will used CAD modeling tool Onshape to visualize potential designs and
          design a chassis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aware that custom designs would take more time and effort but provide
          better learning opportunities.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>7 August</p>
        <p>
          Continued refining the design concept, focusing on motor placement and
          weight distribution.
        </p>
        <p>Used Onshape drawings to finalize initial design sketches.</p>
        <p>
          Decided to prioritize flexibility in motor and sensor integration.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>12 August</p>
        <p>
          Will worked on detailed CAD drawings for the battle bot's structural
          design.
        </p>
        <p>Nic worked on analysing</p>
        <p>
          Matthew analyzed compatibility between Python, Microbit, and other
          hardware components.
        </p>
        <p>
          Identified a potential issue with the power supply for the motors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Revised wiring and battery configurations to ensure the motors
          received adequate power and to the right pins.
        </p>
        <p>
          Concerns about balancing time spent on design vs. time for coding and
          building.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>14 August</p>
        <p>
          Further refined the CAD designs, adjusting motor placement for better
          balance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Matthew confirmed Microbit makecode was the best platform for hardware
          integration.
        </p>
        <p>Spent time analyzing power requirements and motor wiring.</p>
        <p>
          Decision to move forward with building and coding, though time
          management remained a concern.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>19 August</p>
        <p>
          Matthew began coding the motor control using Python and Microbit
          makecode.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initial testing was to see if the motor could be turned on and off,
          but wiring errors caused the motor to malfunction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nic and Matthew conducted research on open-source libraries for motor
          control and sensor integration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Attempted a gradual motor speed control approach but couldn&rsquo;t
          test it due to wiring issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Realized the project would face delays unless wiring was corrected.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>26 August</p>
        <p>
          Will and Matthew started assembling the battle bot, focusing on motor
          placement and chassis stability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Encountered issues with motor alignment, which made the bot unstable;
          had to adjust the chassis design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Electrical wiring errors caused problems with current flow to the
          motor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nic continued researching coding libraries and resources to help
          streamline coding efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Delays due to wiring issues meant progress on coding and testing was
          slow.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>28 August</p>
        <p>
          Matthew and Will spent 1.5 periods soldering wires for other groups.
        </p>
        <p>
          Motor still wasn&rsquo;t functioning due to incorrect wiring
          configurations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The motor was receiving insufficient current, affecting performance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nic began working on the project website, documenting progress and
          challenges.
        </p>

        <p>
          Frustrations were mounting due to the ongoing wiring problems, and
          time pressure was becoming a concern.
        </p>

        <p></p>

        <p>2 September</p>

        <p>
          Matthew simplified the motor control code to troubleshoot one step at
          a time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Will helped test the motor, discovering that inconsistent current flow
          was the main issue.
        </p>

        <p>
          Nic continued developing the website, documenting the project and
          research findings.
        </p>

        <p>
          Realized the main issue was a lack of expertise with electrical
          wiring, delaying both the coding and hardware testing.
        </p>

        <p>Worked on motor alignment, but the wiring problem persisted.</p>

        <p></p>

        <p>4 September</p>
        <p>
          Matthew and Will continued working on the wiring, trying to fix
          current flow problems that were preventing the motor from working
          properly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Simplified code further to focus on motor control, but issues with
          wiring were still hampering progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nic worked on refining the website, documenting the ongoing challenges
          and coding process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Motor performance was inconsistent, but small improvements were made
          with each adjustment.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>9 September</p>
        <p>
          Will and Matthew spent most of the day soldering and adjusting the
          wiring.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally managed to fix the wiring, allowing the motor to run more
          consistently, though some performance issues remained.
        </p>
        <p>Code started functioning correctly after wiring adjustments.</p>
        <p>
          Nic finalized most of the website content, including descriptions of
          the coding process, research, and challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Limited time left for additional sensor integration or performance
          tweaks, but the motor was now functional.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>11 September</p>
        <p>
          Matthew and Will focused on final tweaks to improve motor performance
          and signal consistency.
        </p>
        <p>
          The motor and code were working together, though there were still
          minor speed inconsistencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nic completed the website, documenting the entire project, including
          the wiring and coding challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Time pressure was significant, but the project was nearing completion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soldering and wiring fixes were critical to the final success of the
          motor control, though it left less time for optimizing other areas.

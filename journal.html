        <h1>Evaluation</h1>
        <p>Our battlebot was overall well produced, as the finished product was as expected to what we designed for.</p>
        <p>We first brainstormed the design of it and chose to do a custom build to have full flexibility with the weapon and motor integrations. </p>
        <p>This took a lot of extra work, but it really paid off in the visual aspect with the use of CAD modeling tools to help us see exactly what we were working on and set the foundation quite strong. </p>
        <p>From there on, we encountered numerous roadblocks, including motor control and wiring. </p>
        <p>The constant design refinement, motor repositioning, and simplification of code helped us to identify and iron out these issues.</p> 
        <p>We managed to work through these issues, managed to fix wiring and voltage issues, and worked on ensuring that the motor's operation was consistent. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately due to bad motor the whole bot melted, breaking the acrylic and glue holding some things in place.</p>
        <p>Overall, we are happy with how our bot turned out even though the motor didnâ€™t have enough torque to move the bot forward and back. </p>

        <h1>Journal</h1>
        <strong><p>5 August</p></strong>

        <p>- Nic and Will brainstormed ideas for the battle bot design.</p>

        <p>- Compared prebuilt chassis vs. custom build options.</p>

        <p>
          - Decided to go with a custom design with additional features from
          prebuilt chassis for more flexibility in weapon and motor integration.
        </p>

        <p>
          - Will used CAD modeling tool Onshape to visualize potential designs and
          design a chassis.
        </p>

        <p>- Matt started a python and html code for the website.</p>

        <p>
          - Aware that custom designs would take more time and effort but provide
          better learning opportunities.
        </p>

        <p></p>
        <br>
        <strong><p>7 August</p></strong>

          weight distribution.
        </p>

        <p>- Used Onshape drawings to finalize initial design sketches.</p>

        <p>
          - Decided to prioritize flexibility in motor and sensor integration.
        </p>

        <p>
          - Matt continued with the website code using Flask to build a backend
          and HTML and CSS for the frontend.
        </p>

        <p></p>
        <br>
        <strong><p>12 August</p></strong>

        <p>
          - Will worked on detailed CAD drawings for the battle bot's structural
          design.
        </p>

        <p>- Nic worked on analysing</p>

        <p>
          - Matthew analyzed compatibility between Python, Microbit, and other
          hardware components.
        </p>

        </p>

        <p>
          - Revised wiring and battery configurations to ensure the motors
          received adequate power and to the right pins.
        </p>

        <p>
          - Concerns about balancing time spent on design vs. time for coding and
          building.
        </p>

        <p></p>
        <br>
        <strong><p>14 August</p></strong>

        <p>
          - Further refined the CAD designs, adjusting motor placement for better
          balance.
        </p>

        <p>
          - Matthew confirmed Microbit makecode was the best platform for hardware
          integration.

        <p>
          - Matthew began coding the motor control using Python and Microbit
          makecode.
        </p>

        <p>
          - Initial testing was to see if the motor could be turned on and off,
          but wiring errors caused the motor to malfunction.
        </p>

        <p>
          - Nic and Matthew researched open-source libraries for motor control and
          maybe sensor integration.
        </p>

        <p>
